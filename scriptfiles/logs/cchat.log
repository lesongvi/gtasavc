[2016/1/25 - 0:18:35] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: The Shamals are expensive though.
[2016/1/25 - 0:18:45] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: 1.2m.
[2016/1/25 - 0:18:53] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: I like the fact you cant start the job in LC and have to fly back to VC
[2016/1/25 - 0:19:50] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: thats fair for a job like
[2016/1/25 - 0:19:55] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: like this
[2016/1/25 - 0:21:31] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: how much does a pilots licence cost?
[2016/1/25 - 0:22:5] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: Oh you can start the job in LC so each checkpoint you get 50k
[2016/1/25 - 0:22:51] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: You can only start it in VC.
[2016/1/25 - 0:24:30] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: no you can /pilot in LC it says you need to start in LV but when you arrive in VC you get 50k
[2016/1/25 - 0:25:3] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: It sets a checkpoint back in VC to let you know you need to start it in VC.
[2016/1/25 - 0:25:8] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: This is confusing, even for me.
[2016/1/25 - 0:25:25] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: Then when you arrive at LC point, you get another 50k
[2016/1/25 - 0:25:32] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: VC*

[2016/1/25 - 0:28:38] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: Basiclyy, Fly to LC.  When you hit the checkpoint, /pilot again.
[2016/1/25 - 0:28:55] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: when you return to VC you get another 50k
[2016/1/25 - 0:29:7] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: It's a checkpoint bug.
[2016/1/25 - 0:29:9] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: I see.
[2016/1/25 - 0:29:36] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: at least im not getting banned for this bug :D
[2016/1/25 - 0:31:9] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: It'll kill the economy so quickly. That is, if players ever get a Shamal.
[2016/1/25 - 0:31:35] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: And...you can't get a Shamal from /microshop ;)
[2016/1/25 - 0:31:53] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: in the future you should either remove it Or... make it less payout
[2016/1/25 - 0:32:24] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: It's high for a very good reason, the plane is 1.2m.
[2016/1/25 - 0:32:30] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: Plus they'll have to buy the pilot license.
[2016/1/25 - 0:32:37] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: how much is the licence?
[2016/1/25 - 0:32:47] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: Not sure, I'd need to return to City Hall.

[2016/1/25 - 0:45:20] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: Yeah, that's done.
[2016/1/25 - 0:45:42] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: Sounds silly, but If flying from LC to VC gets you the 50k... 
[2016/1/25 - 0:45:51] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: does it matter what checkpoint you enter.
[2016/1/25 - 0:46:4] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: Eh, that's the problem.
[2016/1/25 - 0:46:12] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: You enter any checkpoint, you get the 50k.
[2016/1/25 - 0:46:41] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: thought so..  but i cant think of anyway to get a checkpoint at VC

[2016/1/30 - 23:37:22] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: You would need to purchase business traffic, then during your paychecks..
[2016/1/30 - 23:37:31] ** Executive Admin Tommy Andrade: You'll start to accumulate random profit.
[2016/1/30 - 23:37:40] ** Chief Advisor Jacob Jones: how do you buy Traffic?
